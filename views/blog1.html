          <em>
            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In this pandemic situation our
            education is standing on internet. We all know that internet is a
            vast suite of information. You can learn any thing from internet but
            that doesn't mean to learn everything. We are humans and our
            knowledge has limitations. In this pandemic, big tech companies
            thinking that a student has to learn more and more and as a student
            I know how it feels to learn new things. The internet is vast and
            there is no limitations on information but I think that we forgot
            how to use information. We are humans and not a hard disk or memory
            device to store this information on our heads.<br />&nbsp;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Our education system teaching us on
            an online mode, and we know it is not an effective technique to
            learn new things. Recently I take a look at books of small kid's, it
            contains so much information that a small kid should never able to
            learn those things in one year of time span and at that early age.
            The syllabus of this small kids are so huge that a grownup child
            will require much efforts to learn those things.<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In an online mode exams, we are all
            aware about how student are giving exam and how they got so much
            marks. The main question here is that the students are not learning
            from internet they using it to only get higher grades and education
            seems worthless because it just becomes a time pass for many
            students. Here is a catch because what a small kid can also do when
            a doubt arrived in her mind, He has no one to answer his question
            and whom he ask. Someone will say to search on internet but as a kid
            he doesn't understand long paragraphs and the higher English words.
            The consequence is that he left the study and start playing. No one
            forced him to sit properly during study, no one say him to do study
            regularly, no one say him to practice problems of math. This all
            things leads to country in very bad future.<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As a student I knew that the
            same condition is happening with everyone and not only with small
            kids. The humans have one of the feeling called as greed. When a
            student have greed of learning, he wandered here and there to learn
            thing and since internet is vast suite of information, the student
            lost in this blackhole of information and he ending up by not
            learning anything. Big tech companies want student have to learn new
            technologies and our college teaching us the technologies of
            1980-90's , the questions arrives here is that what a student has to
            learn and again the student is grinding in both of them. Companies
            want student have certification by this company or by that company
            but really a student get time to learn those things. From my
            personal experience our college thinks that we are at home means we
            are free all day and it is holiday for us but they forget that we
            have to attend lectures and we have to do work. Here all the burden
            of study is pushed on student. The student has to maintain his
            academic study and also learn new skills for companies. The student
            are learning from Youtube, from websites and from many other sources
            and loosing himself in the age of information. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Please take a look at this
            problem and think on it. Observe your child and ask him how much
            problem he is facing, please sit with him and help him in doing his
            study. Observe yourself and don't be a part of this process. Try to
            develop wisdom and don't be a memory device.
            <br />
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you!!!</em
