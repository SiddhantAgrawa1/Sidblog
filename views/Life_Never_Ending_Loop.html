            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We never accept this truth and blaming on little things that why this happened with me? or Why I don't get what I want?. I think that we are not grateful towards our life. We don't understand how great is our life. Many people from us goes into depression due to some common problems like some farmers in us have problems of money so some of them try to do suicide! Is it the solution to your problems! or some students try to do suicide after their fail attempt in exam, is exam is more precious than life, Or some people easily says that they will die at the age of 50, that's your attitude towards life.! Really thus your are in trap of life to escape from it as early as possible. 
            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
            Some of us are living in very worst condition but they don't do suicide because they know the importance of life. Some are living in extreme poverty where they don't have enough many to fulfill their basic needs like food and shelter, Some are living in area having extreme cold like in Antarctica, some are living in area of having very hot temperature like in Saudi Arab, Some are living in war situation area like Afghanistan, Some are living in desert where they don't have enough water. Although with all this problems they are living life because they know the importance of life. They know this are common problems also they have solution too. Israel, this country has lots of problem with food and water but they deal with effectively using some common and scientific technique. They thought some people does not have what we have so we shall provide them those things and they will also help us in solving our problems. In this way they solve problems and become most successful country in past few decades.  
            <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
               We are always grateful towards  our life.  Life is the most precious thing in this world although life is not easy.  Life comes from universe through a great combination of little little elements. The soil,  water,  fire and earth made its greatest combination to form a life. Life has common problems. I am referring problems to common problems because problems are not specific they are already happened with some of us and some of us solve them very well. They are little obstacles and we have to pass them. It's like a game if a game has simple plane track and you have to go some start to end then its boring but if this track has some obstacles and suppose you have to jump on stone or pass through a tunnel then it become interesting. Life is same as this,  Enjoy your life and play it like a pro player. Solve your problems and go into next level to face new interesting problems and in this way you are grateful towards your life and you thinks that this will never over. Love your lifeðŸ’–ðŸ’“ðŸ˜Š. </em>
